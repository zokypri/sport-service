# Description
sport service in Kotlin to be part of the News Agency architecture

# Architecture
As of now the service will be called by news-service which will gather all data to provide to FE
This might change in the near future though. Perhaps a BFF should gather all information

# Tests

Since i rushed this service in the last minute I have so far zero tests but I intend to add proper unit and component tests

# TODO
There is a long list of thing to do in this service since it was rushed to be part of a dockerized multi container environment
